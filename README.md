This Python script utilizes the `pyautogui` library for automating interactions with the Microsoft Edge browser and a web form. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. Imports the necessary libraries: `pyautogui` and `time`.
2. Sets a pause of 1 second between each PyAutoGUI action.
3. Presses the Windows key to open the Start menu.
4. Types "microsoft edge" into the search bar and presses Enter to open Microsoft Edge.
5. Waits for 5 seconds to ensure the browser has opened.
6. Defines a variable `link` containing a file path to a local HTML file.
7. Enters the link into the browser's address bar and presses Enter.
8. Waits for 8 seconds for the page to load.
9. Imports the `pandas` library for reading CSV files.
10. Reads data from a CSV file named "produtos.csv" into a pandas DataFrame.
11. Iterates over each row of the DataFrame.
12. Performs the following actions for each row:
    - Clicks on a specific position on the screen (assuming it's a specific form input field).
    - Writes data from the DataFrame into the form fields.
    - Scrolls down the page.
13. The script finishes its execution.
